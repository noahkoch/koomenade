# Koomenade

Koomenade is a static website host that focuses on being insanely cheap and easy to get going.

### Why?

There are so many services that exist for hosting static services, but for me they all had barriers: 

- Cost
- Time to get deployed
- Difficult user interfaces

Some of the best services range from landing page generators to drag and drop web site editors. Most cost anywhere from $10/month to $25/month depending on what features you want. It doesn't sound like much, but when you're just wanting to test out a stupid idea to see if it has legs, $120/year can add up quick. 

As you get cheaper, services require more technical knowledge. Even if you have the knowledge, like I do, it's a hassle to go into my server and change some config files every time I want to set up a new domain on my site. 

** TL;DR: The goal of Koomenade is to be the [Microsoft Paint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2g5qbvb7F4) of static website hosting; Stupid easy to get going but still allows for more complex ideas to be fleshed out **
